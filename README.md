Project overview:
1. Used Ajax call to Foursqure API to get the location data, with error handling.
2. The location data is formatted to display in info windows on Google Map.
3. A info window opens when the user selects the corresponding location by the
map marker or the list item on the right of the map.
4. Knockout js library is used to bind the data from the location data fetched
from the Foursqure API call.
5. Used Bootstrap grids for responsive app UI.
